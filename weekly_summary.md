 Developer Activity Summary:

- âœ… Completed Work:
  - Iteration on the pose detection functionality for the "AI Form Checker" project.
  - Implemented various pose detection algorithms for three distinct exercises: dumbbell curl, squat, and squat with a barbell.
  - Added feedback mechanisms for correct and incorrect form detection in each exercise.
  - Implemented progress bar and repetition counter for the squat and squat with a barbell exercises.
  - Created necessary utility functions to analyze body positions like calculating angles and distances between landmarks.

- ðŸ›  In Progress:
  - Refining the pose detection algorithms for better accuracy and performance, particularly for the dumbbell curl exercise.
  - Integrating the completed pose detection algorithms with the main application "AI Form Checker" for a more seamless user experience.
  - Adding a user interface to allow users to easily switch between exercises and start/stop the pose detection.

- ðŸ”œ Planned or Upcoming Tasks:
  - Add additional exercises to the "AI Form Checker" application.
  - Implement pose detection for users performing the exercises without a webcam, potentially using a Kinect sensor or other alternatives.
  - Explore possibilities to integrate machine learning models to improve pose detection accuracy and real-time feedback.

- ðŸ“‹ Notes or Observations:
  - Some minor issues regarding disciplined execution of exercises were observed during development. These issues will be addressed in future iterations.
  - The current pose detection algorithms may require further optimization and tuning to achieve optimal performance, especially for realistic user environments.
