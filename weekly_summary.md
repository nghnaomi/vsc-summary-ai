 Developer Activity Summary:

- âœ… Completed Work:
  - Creating a machine learning-based form checker for squat exercise using OpenCV and a custom poseDetector class, which includes finding and drawing the skeleton, calculating angles, and providing feedback on the form.
  - Creating a form checker for a dumbbell curl exercise, calculating the angle of the arm, and providing feedback based on the angle.
  - Adding a progress bar to display the completion percentage for both exercises.
  - Adding functionality to display the frame rate (FPS) of the video feed to show how smoothly the AI model is running.

- ðŸ›  In Progress:
  - Currently working on a love detection exercise using image processing and OpenCV to check if the user is expressing love (based on a raised thumb) or not.

- ðŸ”œ Planned or Upcoming Tasks:
  - There are plans to expand the form checker to include more exercises and improve the accuracy and responsiveness of the pose detection.

- ðŸ“‹ Notes or Observations:
  - It appears that the feedback mechanism for the love detection exercise is not yet complete, as only basic color indication is being shown, and the implementation for checking if the user is expressing love needs to be added later. Also, the 'pTime' variable for storing the previous frame time is overwritten in the first while loop of `ilove.py`, which might affect the FPS calculation in that file. The developer may want to separate the FPS calculation into a separate function or add a way to track the number of iterations instead.
